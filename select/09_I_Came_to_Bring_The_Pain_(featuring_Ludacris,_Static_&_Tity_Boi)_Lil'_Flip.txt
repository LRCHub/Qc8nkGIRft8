I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain, pain
I, I came to bring the pain
I came to, I, I came to bring the pain
I came to, I, I came to, I came to

I came to bring the pain, nigga
And I came to bust them thangs, nigga
The night'll rearrange your frame, nigga
You scared nigga, you scared nigga, one more time

I came to bring the pain, nigga
And I came to change the game, nigga
The night'll rearrange your frame, nigga
You scared nigga, you scared nigga

Get out my face, get out my face, 'cause you's a hoe, hoe
You talk behind my back, back but I know, know
I pack a 4-4, nigga and I bust, bust
And I ain't leavin' this bitch in handcuffs, cuffs

You better put your hands up, get them little budget
Then wrap your fans up but you still won't catch up
'Cause I'm connected on the East, I'm connected on the West
I ain't sayin' I'm the best but I feel like I'm blessed

I got thirty on my neck and twenty in my mouth
But if I feel disrespected, I'ma call your ass out
They gonna haul your ass out, now you cryin' like a bitch
I told you not to fuck with the Screwed Up Clique

I came to bring the pain, nigga
And I came to bust them thangs, nigga
The night'll rearrange your frame, nigga
You scared nigga, you scared nigga, one more time

I came to bring the pain, nigga
And I came to change the game, nigga
The night'll rearrange your frame, nigga
You scared nigga, you scared nigga

Bring the pain, hardcore, sellin' cane, sun, snow, water, rain
Shorty, I will flip this stuff until the task force came
Tried to rearrange the game, tried to bang, suck at slangin'
I got this new slang, I had to switch it up

Wrap a pimp cursin' on the track, the mac will leave you on your back
Strap will leave you with a gap, stop smilin'
Glances you see visions of the past, you see niggaz with masks
Up in cars with no tags when we ballin'

I'm from the apartments, started with all of it
Different day, same clip, so close, I can't miss
Titty, Flip and Ludacris got bricks, roosters, chicks
Snatchin' bread then we dip, it's South Side represent

Now the clique is called D.T.P., so get your crew right
We peer pressure fools, even Dudley don't Do-Right
So go on your city, it's a South rebellion
We puttin' foots in your asses, how we speak Australian

I'm trained in the art of whoop ass, check my accolades
Got a knife and I'm givin' out free after shaves
Plus a new actin' gig, take a look at the clip
It's called one up in the chamber and four on the hip

I snatch your girls in the club and use them as throat throttles
Then you'll get hit with fifteen mini Mo' bottles
Got Glocks for your stocks and that thang for your chains
And mutual guns for your mutual funds, man

Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, you scared, nigga

I came to bring the pain, nigga
And I came to bust them thangs, nigga
The night'll rearrange your frame, nigga
You scared nigga, you scared nigga, one more time

I came to bring the pain, nigga
And I came to change the game, nigga
The night'll rearrange your frame, nigga
You scared nigga, you scared nigga

I came to, I, I came to bring the pain
I came to, I, I came to, I came to, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
I came to bring the pain, I, I came to bring the pain, pain, pain, pain
